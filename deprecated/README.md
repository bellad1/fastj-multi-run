# Fast-J Multi-Run Analysis System
A comprehensive Python framework for running multiple Fast-J photolysis rate calculations with varying aerosol properties, featuring automatic checkpointing, result storage, and analysis tools.

This directory is for running Fast-Jx for many cases (i.e., the entire
ACTIVATE dataset). 

Assumptions for this 1st iteration: 
1) we use simply the FINE mode values for everything (e.g., AOD, SSA, asymmetry param)
2) we assume the phase function shape (H-G) and use asymmetry param to calc
phase function expansion coeff.
