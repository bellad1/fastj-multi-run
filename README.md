## Overview

Necessary aerosol properties to run this code are aerosol optical depth (AOD),
single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry factor (G), and aerosol layer top
height. NOTE: this code was originally designed to calculate photolsyis rates
using aerosol property retrievals from the NASA 
[ACTIVATE](https://science.larc.nasa.gov/activate/) campaign and the
[MAPP](https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-57-10-2394&id=383916)
retrieval framework (Stamnes et al., 2018).

This repository contains tools for:
- Processing retrieved aerosol properties from RSP (Research Scanning Polarimeter) and HSRL (High Spectral Resolution Lidar) measurements with the MAPP retrieval framework.
- Running Fast-J photolysis rate calculations with varying aerosol contditions
- Managing large-scale computational campaigns with checkpointing
- Analyzing and storing results efficiently using Dask arrays

## Features

- **Multi-run capabilities**: Process thousands of aerosol scenarios automatically
- **Checkpointing**: Resume interrupted calculations
- **Memory efficiency**: Uses Dask for large dataset handling
- **Multiple output formats**: Zarr, HDF5, NumPy support
- **Incremental saving**: Save results periodically during long runs
- **Data validation**: Hash-based run identification and duplicate prevention

## System Requirements
- Fast-J executable (compiled from Fortran source)
- Python 3.7+
- Sufficient disk space for results (varies by campaign size)

### Core Dependencies
python dependencies:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas dask
```
fast-JX executable:
```bash
ln -snf /Path/To/FastJX/Executable/fastJX ./fastJX
```

### Optional Dependencies (for enhanced functionality)
```
pip install zarr h5py  # For efficient large array storage
```

## Quick Start
### 1. Data Preparation
This code was designed to focus on impacts of different aerosol types.
**Therefore, CSV input data files must contain an 'aerosol_tag', such as
'Urban_Pollution', which is proceeded by the aerosol property and an underscore
(AOD_, SSA_, G_).**\
\
As an example, for 'Urban_Pollution', ensure your CSV files are organized as:\
```
aerosol_fastJcsvFiles/
â”œâ”€â”€ AOD_Urban_Pollution.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ SSA_Urban_Pollution.csv
â””â”€â”€ G_Urban_Pollution.csv

aerosol_heights/
â””â”€â”€ HSRL_Urban_Pollution_hts.csv
```
### 2. Basic Usage (running with testData)
**NOTE:** Before proceeding, make sure you have a symbolic link to the fast-J
executable in this working directory (see instructions above). If you name the
fast-J executable the same as above, no edits are needed to multiRunFastJ.py
to run with testData.
```python
from multiRunFastJ import main

### Run with default configuration
results_array, metadata = main()
```

### 3. Custom Configuration (example aerosol_tag = 'Marine')
Edit the configuration section in multiRunFastJ.py:
```python
# ========================================================================
# CONFIGURATION SECTION - Modify these parameters as needed
# ========================================================================
# Set aerosol tag name. NOTE: must match aerosol_tag in csvFiles (i.e., if
# csv files contain properties on Pol_Marine aerosols (with files,
# AOD_Pol_Marine.csv, SSA_Pol_Marine.csv, ...), then aerosol_tag
# is 'Pol_Marine'
aerosol_tag = 'Marine'

# Define directories containing csv files (showing with testData)
csvDir_aerosolProps = './testData/aerosol_properties'
# NOTE: for the heights in testData, we have RSP and HSRL derived heights. Don't forget to update the path
csvDir_aerosolHeight = './testData/aerosol_heights/HSRL'

# Number of runs to process (None = all available)
max_runs = 100  # SET TO 1 FOR TESTING, any number for chunks, or None (all)

# Output processing options
store_mean_intensity = False  # Set to True if you want mean intensity data
output_method = 'full_2d'  # Options: 'surface_only', 'altitude_integrated', 'flatten', 'full_2d'

# File saving options
append_to_existing = True
fixed_run_name = aerosol_tag  # This is different from aerosol_tag and can be named whatever
save_format = 'zarr'  # Options: 'zarr', 'numpy', 'hdf5'

# Incremental saving (recommended for long runs)
incremental_save = True  # save results periodically
save_every = 20  # save after every 20 runs

# File paths
checkpoint_file = 'fastj_checkpoint.json'
executable_path = './fastJX'  # NOTE: must match fast-Jx executable
```

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ multiRunFastJ.py              # Main multi-run script
â”œâ”€â”€ collocationTest_multiFile.py  # Data collocation and processing
â”œâ”€â”€ AOD_Urban_Pollution.csv       # Aerosol optical depth data
â”œâ”€â”€ HSRL_Urban_Pollution_hts.csv  # Aerosol layer heights
â”œâ”€â”€ jVals.dat                     # Example Fast-J output
â”œâ”€â”€ meanIntensity.dat             # Example mean intensity output
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # This file
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
```

## Input Data
To run this code, the user is responsible for creating aerosol property
(AOD, SSA, G) and aerosol layer height input files. This is a total of 4 input
files for each aerosol type (e.g., aerosol_tag).
**NOTE:** The number of rows of data for aerosol properties/heights should
match

### Aerosol Properties
**IMPORTANT:** aerosol properties at the retrieved wavelengths had to be
interpolated/extrapolated to Fast-J wavelengths. This introduces uncertainty
that has not been quantified.

**FORMAT:** CSV files with wavelengths in header row and aerosol property
(AOD, SSA, G) retrieval values in subsequent rows (need a separate csv file
for each property):
```csv
187.0,191.0,193.0,196.0,...
0.123,0.145,0.156,0.167,...
0.098,0.112,0.125,0.134,...
```
### Height Data
**FORMAT:** Single column CSV with header (header contents not important,
just ensure header is single line):
```csv
HSRL Aerosol Heights for Urban/Pollution
2450.0
1890.0
3120.0
```

## Output Data

### J-values
Photolysis rates for atmospheric species at different altitudes:
- Surface-only: J-values at ground level
- Full 2D: Complete altitude-species matrix
- Altitude-integrated: Column-integrated values

### Mean intensity (optional)
The mean intensity (actinic flux) at different altitudes for all fast-J
wavelengths
- Must set store_mean_intensity = True

### Storage Formats
- **Zarr**: Recommended for large datasets
- **NumPy**: Simple .npz format
- **HDF5**: Industry standard scientific format

## Configuration Options

### Processing Methods
- `surface_only`: Extract ground-level photolysis rates
- `full_2d`: Preserve complete altitudeÃ—species arrays
- `altitude_integrated`: Integrate over atmospheric column
- `flatten`: Simple 1D flattening

### Checkpointing
Automatic resume capability using fastj_checkpoint.json:
```json
{
  "completed_runs": ["hash1", "hash2", ...],
  "saved_runs": ["hash1", "hash2", ...]
}
```

## Example Usage
Make the following changes in the "CONFIGURATION SECTION" of multiRunFastJ.py

### 1. Small test run (returning only surface j-values)
```python
# Test with 10 cases
max_runs = 10
output_method = 'surface_only'
save_format = 'numpy'
fixed_run_name = 'Urban_Pollution'
```

### 2. Process entire field campaign (e.g., ACTIVATE)
```python
# Full dataset processing (e.g., large csv files)
max_runs = None  # All available
output_method = 'full_2d'
save_format = 'zarr'
incremental_save = True
save_every = 50
fixed_run_name = 'Urban_Pollution'
```

### 3. Resume Interrupted Run
```python
# Automatically resumes from checkpoint
append_to_existing = True
fixed_run_name = 'Urban_Pollution'
```

## Analyzing Results

### Loading Saved Results
```python
from multiRunFastJ import load_results

# Load by fixed_run_name
results, metadata = load_results(run_name='Urban_Pollution')

# Quick analysis
from multiRunFastJ import analyze_results_quick
analysis = analyze_results_quick(results, metadata)
```

### Available Tools
- `list_saved_runs()`: Browse available datasets
- `debug_saved_files()`: Troubleshoot file issues
- `analyze_results_quick()`: Basic statistical analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing executable**: Ensure fastJX is compiled and executable. Create
   a symbolic link from the fastJX source directory to your working directory
with 
```bash
ln -snf /Path/To/FastJX/Executable/fastJX ./fastJX
```
2. **Memory errors**: Reduce chunk sizes or use incremental saving
3. **File format errors**: Check CSV structure and headers
4. **Checkpoint corruption**: Delete and restart from clean state

# Debug Functions
```python
# Check saved files
from multiRunFastJ import debug_saved_files
debug_saved_files('fastj_results')

## List available runs
from multiRunFastJ import list_saved_runs
runs = list_saved_runs()
```
